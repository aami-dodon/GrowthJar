# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The GrowthJar team actively maintains the latest minor release of the `main` branch. We provide security updates for:

| Version               | Supported          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `main` branch         | :white_check_mark: |
| Latest minor release  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases        | :x:                |

Security patches are generally backported to the most recent release train when technically feasible. Versions that have reached end-of-life will not receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a public issue. Instead:

1. Email the security team at `security@growthjar.io` with the subject line `SECURITY`. Use encrypted communication if possible.
2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, affected components, and potential impact.
3. Include any proof-of-concept code, logs, or screenshots that help demonstrate the issue.

We aim to acknowledge receipt within **2 business days** and will provide status updates at least once per week until the issue is resolved.

## Disclosure Process

- After validating the report, we will work with you to develop a fix and coordinate a release.
- Please allow us reasonable time to deploy the fix before publicly disclosing the issue (a 90-day embargo is typical, though urgent cases may be resolved sooner).
- Credit will be given to reporters who request acknowledgment in the release notes, unless anonymity is preferred.

## Scope

The security policy applies to all code, infrastructure, and services hosted within the GrowthJar GitHub organization, including the `client`, `server`, and any supporting tooling defined in this repository.

## Non-Security Issues

For non-security bugs, feature requests, or general questions, please use GitHub Issues or Discussions instead of the security channel.
